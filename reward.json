        "ai_written": "### Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder\n\nDick stood on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed to the south. Behind him, the waves of the outer sea crashed against the reef, sending spray into the air. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out, calm and blue, dotted with fishing gulls. This vast, enclosed sea was his now, a place of storms in rough winds and a tranquil lake in gentle breezes. He had arrived here just yesterday.\n\nThe beach was bustling with activity. Women, children, and young men were busy fishing, playing games, or working on their paraka patches. All of them were his people now. The canoes on the sand and the empty houses where war canoes once rested were his too.\n\nAs he looked from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. He turned away from the lagoon and faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond that horizon, invisible but ever-present, lay Palm Tree Island, a place of beauty and danger.\n\nLittle Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral. Tari knew little about life, but he understood that the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless. Yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago. The women said this stranger was sent by the gods to be their new chief.\n\nTari looked up at Dick. \"Taori,\" he asked, \"who are you?\"\n\nDick couldn't answer Tari's question in a way the boy would understand. He couldn't tell him about his past, about being stranded on Palm Tree Island with an old sailor named Kearney, or about Katafa, who had taught him her language and named him Taori. His memory of his early life was hazy, blurred by the years of isolation and the tropical sun.\n\nThe past for a man long shipwrecked and alone becomes a foggy haze. For Dick, his past began with Katafa's arrival on Palm Tree Island. Everything before that was lost in the bright light of the tropics and the storms that swept the coconut groves.\n\nHe looked down at Tari. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tari replied. \"I ask questions like I breathe, but no one ever answers them.\" His attention was already diverted by the cries of children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n\nDick turned his gaze back to the north. Tari's question had stirred memories of the schooner that had been burned by the Melanesian men on Palm Tree Island. He remembered escaping with Katafa in the old dinghy and their arrival on this beach yesterday. The women and children had swarmed around him, believing he was sent by the gods to be their leader.\n\nBut the beauty of the sea and sky was marred by the memory of the men who had taken over Palm Tree. They had no canoes yet, but they would build them. They would see the lagoon's reflection in the sky and come here. It might take a long time, but they would come.\n\nDick was a man of two worlds, a blend of the savage and the civilized. He could think ahead, plan, and imagine. That's why he had sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three old men skilled in canoe-building. He also noticed that nearly a hundred of the youths were nearing the age for war. But above all, his mind was driven by his love for Katafa, his other self, more precious to him than his own life.\n\nA hand fell on his shoulder. He turned to find Katafa standing beside him, a lock of her dark hair blowing in the breeze. Her eyes were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look,\" she said.\n\nThrough a mirage, Palm Tree Island was visible, rising from the horizon like a ghostly apparition. They saw it again, the place of their escape, now a distant threat. They remembered the horde of savages on the beach, the wind filling the sail as they raced for safety, and the yells of the Melanesians.\n\nAs Dick gazed at the island, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him, but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa. They would come someday, drawn by the same instincts that had brought him to her. They would scan the horizon, seeking an island to raid for women, and they would see the lagoon's light.\n\nThe vision of Palm Tree began to fade, and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.",

        "ai_written": "### Chapter 2: The Old Men's Rebellion\n\nTwo women paddled their canoe to shore, the outrigger tilting as they beached it. Dick, followed by Katafa, approached them. He leaned on the mast stays attached to the outrigger and turned to the women, who stood with paddles in hand, looking from him to Katafa.\n\n\"Where are the builders?\" Dick asked.\n\nThe shorter woman clicked her tongue and turned away towards the lagoon. The taller one looked Dick straight in the face.\n\n\"They won't come,\" she said. \"They say Uta Matu was their only king, and he's dead. They claim they're too old to build canoes anymore.\"\n\nThe shorter woman choked back a laugh and turned to Dick. \"They won't come, Taori. Everything else is just talk.\"\n\nDick's anger flashed in his eyes, but he quickly replaced it with thought. This was serious. The men who could build the big war canoes were refusing to work, and if he didn't do something, his authority would crumble.\n\nDick didn't waste time. He rushed to the house where the little model ships were stored and returned with a fish spear. He called to the women, helped them push the canoe back into the water, and boarded it. With the women crouching down to balance the canoe, he steered them out to sea.\n\nThe canoe that had brought Katafa to Palm Tree years ago had been the first South Sea island craft Dick had ever seen. He had been fascinated by it ever since. This canoe was bigger and broader, with a long, skate-shaped outrigger connected by a bridge instead of poles.\n\nAs Dick steered, he took in every detail—the rattan grating, the mast stays, the outrigger, and the mat sail. Though he had never steered a canoe before, his innate sea-sense guided him. The women watched, noting every move, and saw no signs of hesitation.\n\nThere were two ways to capsize a canoe: letting the outrigger tilt too high or dip too deep. Dick avoided both dangers as they crossed the big swell coming in with the flood from the reef break.\n\nThe beach where the remnants of the southern tribe lived was directly opposite the northern beach. As they approached, Dick saw the few remaining huts under a grove of jackfruit trees, with pandanus palms bending towards the lagoon and three tall coconut palms against the white horizon.\n\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the rebels. Three old men sat on the sand near the easternmost hut, under the shadow of jackfruit leaves. One girl lay by the edge of a small pool.\n\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the witch woman of Karolin. Le Moan was fourteen, tall and beautiful, with a dark beauty just beginning to bloom. Her European features set her apart from the other islanders. She had heard about the new ruler and Katafa's return. She had also heard her grandfather Aioma refuse to build canoes.\n\nLe Moan wondered what this new chief might be like. The memory of Uta Matu, the last king of Karolin, came to mind. As the canoe was hauled up and the women cried out, \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\n\nDick, with the sun on his face and red-gold hair, stood naked and honey-colored, lithe as a panther and straight as a spear. He walked past Le Moan without a word and stood facing Aioma, the eldest and greatest of the canoe-builders.\n\nLe Moan drew in her breath, then seemed to stop breathing as Dick approached. She was captivated by his presence, so different from anyone she had ever seen.\n\n\"You are Aioma?\" Dick asked, singling out the chief by instinct.\n\nThe three old men stood up. The sight of the newcomer helped, but it was Dick's instinctive recognition of Aioma that truly impressed them. Surely here was a chief.\n\n\"I am Aioma,\" the old man replied. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"That which the women already told you,\" Dick said, hating to repeat himself.\n\n\"They told me about the new chief who had come to the northern beach and ordered canoes to be built,\" Aioma said. \"I said I am too old, and Uta is dead. I know no chief but Uta. In the last war, all the men of Karolin fell, and they have never returned. What is the use of building more canoes when there are no men to fill them?\"\n\n\"The men are growing,\" Dick said.\n\n\"Ay, they are growing,\" Aioma grumbled, \"but it will be many moons before they are ready to take the paddle and the spear—and even so, where is the enemy? The sea is clear.\"\n\n\"Aioma,\" Dick said, \"I have come from there,\" pointing to the north. \"The sea is not clear.\"\n\n\"You have come from Marua?\" Aioma asked.\n\n\"I have come from Marua, where one day Katafa came, drifted from here in her canoe. There we lived until a little while ago when men landed, killing and burning—even the big canoe they had come in. Then Katafa and I set sail for Karolin, for Karolin called me to rule her people.\"\n\n\"And the men who landed to kill and burn?\" Aioma asked.\n\n\"They are still on Marua; they have no canoes but they will build them, and surely they will come.\"\n\nNeither of Aioma’s companions said a word as Aioma stood looking at the ground, as if consulting it. Then his eyes rose to Dick’s face. Age and war had made Aioma wise; he knew men and he knew Truth when he saw her.\n\n\"I will do your bidding, Taori,\" Aioma said simply. He turned to the others, gave them directions, and led the way to the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, still crouching by the well, said nothing. Her eyes were fixed on Dick, this creature so new and different. Perhaps the spirit of her father's race was telling her that here was a being miraculously come to Karolin, or perhaps she was simply held by the grace and youth of the newcomer—who knows?\n\nDick, as he turned, noticed her fully for the first time. Their eyes met, and he paused, held by her gaze and the strangeness of her appearance. For a moment, his mind seemed trapped, then as his eyes fell, he passed on and took the steering paddle, pushing off. The wind from the reef-break filled the sail of the canoe.\n\nLe Moan rose and shaded her eyes, watching as the sail grew smaller across the sparkling water. She watched as the canoe rose and fell on the swell setting in from the break, watching as it reached the far white line of the northern beach where Katafa was waiting for the return of her lover.",

However, it deviates considerably from the original's plot, introducing a new scene with the fish spear and sea voyage which, while creative, diminishes faithfulness to the source material.  The ending is also abrupt.\n\n\nAreas of improvement:\n\n1. **Increase faithfulness:**  Reintegrate elements from the original chapter that were omitted, particularly the villagers' reactions and the central theme of the old men's revolt. The new scene could be added *after* resolving the issue of the canoe builders, rather than replacing it entirely.\n\n2. **Complete the narrative:** The rewritten chapter ends mid-sentence.  The reader is left hanging.  Provide a conclusion to the scene at sea, showing the outcome of Dick's trip to the canoe builders.  What happened next? Did he convince them?\n\n3. **Maintain consistent tone:** The tone shifts slightly between the descriptive passages and the dialogue.  Maintaining a consistent, engaging style throughout would enhance the overall effect.\n",

He was lithe, straight, and honey-colored, with eyes fixed on the old men.\n\nLe Moan drew in her breath, captivated by the vision. She was tall for her age, almost as tall as Katafa, with a dark beauty just beginning to bloom. Her European features set her apart from the other islanders. She was strange, sometimes seeming to hear voices or see visions from distant lands.\n\nLe Moan was a natural navigator. Blindfolded on the coral, she could find her way.

        "ai_written": "### Chapter 3: The Little Ships\n\nThe traditional canoe of the Pacific is a dugout—a tree trunk hollowed out and shaped into a boat. These canoes are narrow and unstable, but they're stabilized by an outrigger. The outrigger is a long, skate-shaped piece of wood attached to the side of the canoe by poles on a central bridge. It's a necessary addition to keep the canoe from tipping over in the sea. Without the outrigger, these canoes wouldn't be seaworthy, and the islands would be isolated, making travel and communication between them nearly impossible.\n\nCenturies ago, someone invented the outrigger, likely never imagining the profound impact it would have on island life. It enabled people to navigate the seas, connecting islands and continents, and even facilitating trade and warfare.\n\nAs Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted a figure waiting for him. It was Katafa, her hair blowing in the wind and her hand shielding her eyes from the sun. She stood just as Le Moan did on the southern beach, watching the canoe approach. Children played nearby, and a fishing canoe was setting out to sea, but Dick's eyes were fixed on Katafa.\n\n“Katafa,” Aioma, crouched by the after outrigger pole, said. “It’s her, just as they said. They thought she was dead and that her ghost had returned with you, Taori. But the dead don’t come back. Katafa was under the taboo of Taminan, untouchable by anyone. Then one day, she went fishing beyond the reef and was swept away by a storm. They said she drowned.”\n\n“She didn’t drown,” Dick replied. “The wind blew her to Marua, where I was. I was with Kearney, who built canoes differently. One day, he went into the forest and never returned. Then the god Nan came to the island, followed by the Karolin men who fought and were all killed. After that, bad men arrived and would have killed us, but we escaped Marua in the night. Look, there’s the dinghy we came in.”\n\nDick pointed to the small boat hauled up on the beach. As soon as his feet touched the sand, he ran to Katafa and embraced her. They had been apart for only a few hours, but it felt like weeks.\n\nDick’s mother, Emmeline, had always been anxious when separated from his father, even by the width of a lagoon. Dick seemed to inherit that anxiety, feeling a deep dread of anything that might harm Katafa.\n\nAioma, the canoe-builder, immediately headed towards the dinghy, running like a boy. He ran his hand over the planking, marveling at the craftsmanship. The dinghy was carvel-built, with planks laid edge to edge, unlike the clinker-built boats of the Spanish ship that had been destroyed in a fight. The dinghy was a perfect example of eastern boat-building, and Aioma was captivated by it, forgetting everything else around him.\n\nThe idea of a boat built from planks rather than a hollowed-out tree trunk had been sparked by the remnants of the Spanish boats. However, Aioma couldn’t figure out how to get the planks or bend them into the shape he wanted. He saw that these boats had a backbone and ribs, covered by planks, which gave them enough stability to do without an outrigger. But he wondered about speed—these boats seemed slow and clumsy.\n\nAioma, standing in the sun, began to mock the dinghy. He chuckled at first, then laughed loudly, deriding its design. “Which end is which on this pig fish?” he joked. “And how many more like it did the maker build?”\n\nDick, who had always associated the dinghy with Kearney, felt a pang of anger at Aioma’s laughter. Perhaps it was the white man in him, revolting against the ridicule of a “savage” over the work of a white man. He turned and ran up the beach to the house he shared with Katafa. There, on a hastily built shelf, stood the little model ships he had rescued from Palm Tree: a frigate, a schooner, a full-rigged ship, and a whaler. These models were his last connection to civilization, toys from a distant past that now held a deeper significance.\n\nHe took the schooner model and ran to a large pool in the coral. The pool was clear and filled with tiny fish darting about. Dick launched the schooner, and Aioma watched as it floated smoothly. Dick demonstrated how the model could sail almost against the wind, showing off his deep knowledge of sailing. Aioma was fascinated, and soon they were both on their knees, playing with the model schooner in the pool. The little boat sailed from one end to the other, bowing to the ripples as if it were a real ship on the open sea.\n\nIn that moment, under the sun, the builders of Karolin’s future fleet played like children, their eyes filled with wonder and excitement. The little schooner, a model of the lost Raratonga, sailed gracefully in its miniature sea, a symbol of the vast possibilities that lay ahead.",

        "ai_written": "### Chapter 5: The Arrival of the Unknown\n\nLe Moan didn't look back as she steered her canoe straight toward the southern shore. The sea gate to her left was a swirl of coral and tide, with gulls dancing in the breeze like snowflakes against the blue sky. To her right, the lagoon stretched out endlessly. Ahead lay a desolate beach, a ruined village, and a wild tangle of pandanus trees, their branches sprawling like an elm's and their fronds tossing in the wind.\n\nShe dragged her canoe above the tide line and turned right along the sand, passing the trees and climbing the coral. She stood for a moment, facing south and the empty sea. Then, turning, she gazed across the lagoon to the distant northern shore, where the trees peeked above the water's shimmer.\n\nThe lagoon was near full tide, brimming with water that flowed in great sheets of smoky blue, streaks of amethyst, and cobalt between the breakers. Le Moan could hear the water sucking through the gates, distinct from the sound of the breakers on the coral. Beyond the breakers, the gulls cried, and beyond them, silence stretched to the white trade clouds on the horizon.\n\nShe was alone, but she had always been alone. Aioma and the two old men, the women, and children who made up the last of the southern tribe had never been her companions. She had fished with them, helped with cooking and making mats, talked with them, lived with them, yet she had always felt apart.\n\nPerhaps it was the racial difference or some inner trait from her mixed heritage that made her feel so isolated, relying only on herself—a spirit apart. She had the power to lose herself in clear water, as Dick had first seen her doing by the pond. Great distances held her in the same way, and her uncanny sense of direction was more psychic than instinctive. Her mind, eternally connected to the wind, sea, sun, and stars, could foresee storms and sea changes that brought tiger sharks into the lagoon, altered the course of fish, or drove the palu far from the fishing banks.\n\nAfter gazing northward for a while, she turned back toward the deserted houses and prepared some food. Then she mended her fishing lines, cleared oap from the paraka patch, and watched the sunset. As the stars came out, she slept deeply, as if in the great depths beyond the palu bank.\n\nHad Le Moan looked back over her past, she would have seen a succession of days like the one just ended, stretching into years, colored by rainy seasons and storms. Nights had been free of human dreams until tonight, when, towards dawn, a ghostly canoe man appeared in her sleep, paddling towards her across a shimmering lagoon.\n\nAs the dream broke and the vision vanished, Le Moan awoke with fear gripping her heart. The dawn was breaking, and the fishing gulls were heading out to sea. She listened, her eyes fixed on the great fan of light in the eastern sky, where the gulls looked like withered leaves tossed by the wind.\n\nNothing. The sea breeze stirred the leaves of the breadfruit and pandanus palms, then fell flat, dying out and changing to the first stirrings of a land breeze. The highest-flying gulls took on color, and the ghostly lagoon took form.\n\nLe Moan rose and swept the lagoon with her eyes. Nothing. Then, turning, she passed between the trees to the coral of the outer beach. There, out on the ghostly sea, touched by the light of dawn, she saw a ship.\n\nYears after the destruction of the Spanish ship, which had happened before her birth, a whaler had put into the lagoon, cut wood, taken on water, been attacked by Uta Matu, the chief of Karolin, and escaped to the outer sea by a miracle.\n\nUta would have sent her to the bottom of the lagoon after the Spaniard, for in his ignorant but instinctive heart, he knew that the black man’s burden is the white man and that civilization to the savage means death.\n\nLe Moan could still see, as if in a dark mirror, the fight and escape of the whaler. And now, here was another ship, different in shape from the one of long ago, but stirring in her mind an instinct of antagonism and dread.\n\nThe ship, which had been standing off and on all night, was a schooner. As the sun rose higher and golden ripples broke the sea line, Le Moan watched it take fire, sail after sail catching the light until a golden ship lay heaving on the swell, circled by golden gulls whose voices came chanting against the breeze like the voices of ghostly sailors.\n\nThen, as the ship altered its helm and the wind shivered out of its canvas, a boat was lowered. It ran up a sail, and Le Moan, shielding her eyes from the rising sun, saw it heading for the break. She ran back among the trees, her hand pressed against her forehead, her mind in confusion, with one idea fixed and steadfast—Taori.\n\nDanger loomed. Instinct backed by recollection told her so. The powerful instinct of a mind that could tell north from south without star or compass, foresee weather changes, and track fish movements had awakened her with fear.\n\nHere was danger to Taori. As she stood, her hand clasped to her forehead, she recalled not only Uta Matu’s fight against the whaler but also Taori’s words to Aioma about the bad men on Marua and the need to build war canoes. The young men of Karolin would soon be ready for war.\n\nBut the canoes were not built, and the warriors were not ready. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, this great canoe with sails spreading to the sky had appeared. Uta Matu and his warriors and fleet were gone, and Taori was unprepared. Then came the thought that the boat heading for the break was like the pilot fish that scouts ahead of the tiger shark. It would come into the lagoon, and if it found food worth devouring, the tiger shark would follow.\n\nThe village on the northern beach was invisible from the break, hidden by the trees and the cunning way Uta Matu had set it among them. She remembered that.\n\nThen her heart blazed with determination. She would save Taori.\n\nLe Moan left the trees and, taking the sand of the inner beach, began running toward the break. She would attract the boat to her.\n\nYou’ve seen a bird distracting a predator away from its nest, heedless of its own fate, thinking only of the thing it loves. Just so, Le Moan, facing the unknown, which was more terrible than the terrible, sought now to save the being she loved with a love that casts out fear.\n\nShe had not run a hundred yards when the boat entered the lagoon, heeling to the breeze and carried by the first of the flood. She flung up her arms to it, then stood watching as it changed its course, heading straight toward her.\n\nIt was an ordinary ship’s quarter boat, painted white, fitted with a mast and lug sail. Le Moan, standing paralyzed and waiting for her fate, saw that it held four men: three kanakas, whose naked shoulders showed above the gunwale, and a huge man, black-bearded and wearing a broad-brimmed white straw hat. His face showed dark and terrible as the face of the King of Terrors.\n\nHe wore a shirt open at the throat, and his shirt sleeves were rolled up, showing arms white yet covered with black hair. As the boat grounded and the kanakas sprang out, Le Moan scarcely saw them; her eyes were fixed on the great man now standing on the beach, Colin Peterson, one of the last of the sandalwood traders, master and owner of the Kermadec—Black Peterson, terrible to look at, swift to strike when roused, yet a man with kindness in his heart and straightness in his soul.\n\nPoor Le Moan, had she only known!\n\nPeterson, sweeping his eyes over the empty and ruined houses and the desolate beach, fixed them on the girl. He spoke to her in a tongue she did not understand and then called out, “Sru!”\n\nA kanaka stepped forward. He was a Paumotuan, half-Malanesian, fierce of face, frizzy-headed, and wearing a necklace of little shells. After a word with Peterson, he turned to Le Moan and spoke to her in a language she understood. The language of Karolin was the language of the Paumotas; those far-off islands in the distant days had raided and fought with Karolin. Neither Le Moan nor Sru knew of this common ancestry that gave them the power of speech.\n\n“I am here alone,” said Le Moan, answering Sru. “My people are gone—a storm took them all. There is no one here.” As she spoke, her eyes wandered northward to the far trace of the northern beach. The dread in her heart was that Taori might, by some ill chance, put out fishing, show himself, and be lost. But nothing appeared, nothing but the far-distant trees above the sun blaze on the water.\n\nShe knew that the schooner was too far off and too much sheltered by the southern reef for the people on the north beach to see her. Taori would be busy with the canoe building, yet the dread in her heart drove her to repeat the words automatically. “There is no one here but me—my people are gone; a storm took them—I am here alone.” As she spoke, she watched Peterson with side glances. She had never seen a bearded man before, and this man with the black curling hair reaching almost to his eyes seemed a monster.\n\nWhilst she was speaking, the other kanakas, taking two large water breakers from the boat, began to fill them at the well. Colin Peterson stood looking at them, half-turned from Le Moan and seeming to have forgotten her existence. Then, shading his eyes, he looked across and about the lagoon, but he was thinking neither of the kanakas nor the lagoon. He was cursing Le Moan.\n\nHe had no use for this girl. He had come ashore for water at this uncharted island, thinking maybe to find natives, never dreaming that he would be faced by a problem like this. It was impossible to leave the forlorn creature to her fate, yet what was he to do with her on board the Kermadec? Had it been a man or a boy, the matter would have been simple enough, but a girl? If he took her off, he would have to find her a home somewhere among the kanakas on one of the northern islands. He was bound for Amao, but he reckoned that place was of no use—the kanakas were a bad lot.\n\nAs he stood thinking and staring about her, Le Moan still watched him, this terrific man who seemed searching with his eyes for Taori.\n\nWould he believe her story—would he kill her? Old tales of the terrible papalagi chased through her mind like bats in the dusk that had fallen upon her powers of thought—she did not know. She only knew that she did not care whether he killed her or not as long as he believed her story and departed without hurting Taori.\n\nThen, suddenly, the last breaker of water in the boat, Peterson turned on Sru and shouted to him to fetch her on board. Perplexity in Peterson generally expressed itself in blasphemy, and when Big Feller Mass’r Peterson began to talk like that, Sru never waited for the toe of the boot that was sure to follow.\n\nHe seized Le Moan by the arm and pushed her to the boat. For a moment, she resisted, then she gave up, tumbled in, and squatting forward of the mast saw, as one sees in a dream, the straining shoulders and tense arms of the kanakas as, bending and clutching the port and starboard gunwales, they ran the boat out. She saw them tumble on board, felt the grating of the sand and then the balloon-like lift of the waterborne keel. She saw the sail above her take the wind and bulge hard against the blue of the sky. She saw the flying gulls and the wheeling lagoon and the trees of the southern beach vanishing to starboard as the boat headed for the break. But always and above everything, she saw the massive hand of Peterson as he sat in the stern sheets with the tiller in the crook of his elbow and his eyes fixed toward her and beyond.\n\nThe sea! What tragedies has it not been partner in? The sea of storms, the blue laughing sea, the sea that now, lovely in the light of morning, was flooding gently with the first of the flood through the gates of Karolin, lifting the boat to the outer swell as it passed the coral piers where the gulls cried above the foam of the breakers and the breakers answered to the crying gulls.\n\nIf Peterson had killed Le Moan on the beach, she would have met her death without flinching. Seated now, watching Karolin drop astern, her eyes never wavered nor softened—even her fear of Peterson had vanished. It was as though she had died on passing the gates of the great atoll and entered a land where personality was not, only perception. A land of pictures that had no relationship to herself or anything she had ever known. She saw as they came alongside the white-painted side of the Kermadec with the ladder cast down, the rail, and above the rail, the great white sail spaces all a-shiver in the wind. The faces of men looking down at the boat, the face of Rantan the mate, and Carlin, a beachcomber picked up at Soma and working his passage north.\n\nThen she was on the deck, which seemed to her broad and white as a beach. The extraordinary newness of this strange place took on a cutting edge that pierced the deadness that had fallen upon her—this place so vast to her mind that it seemed land of a sort. A moment before, in the boat, the sea had been around her, but here the sea was nothing, this place was everything. Taori, Karolin, the reef, the ocean itself, all for a moment vanished, consumed by the Kermadec as by a flame.\n\nAnd not a soul took notice of her after the first few words of Peterson to the mate. They were busy getting in the boat, and now as the rumbling and threshing of the canvas above died out and the sails filled hard against the blue, came the voices of gulls, gulls from the reef and deep-sea gulls flitting in the wake of the Kermadec that was now under way.\n\nLe Moan, feeling herself unnoticed and moving cautiously, came to the weather rail. She saw the reef and the distant trees of Karolin and the following gulls now flying north and south as if giving up the chase. Then the reef line passed from sight beneath the sea dazzle, and the voice of the reef and the crying of the gulls died far off, whilst the tree-tops vainly fought with the ever-growing distance, now clinging to the sight, now washed utterly away.",
