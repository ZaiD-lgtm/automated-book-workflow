Chapter 3\nChapter 2\n\u2192\n\u200b\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE LITTLE SHIPS\n\nT\nHE primitive canoe of the Pacific is a dugout\u2014the trunk of a tree hollowed and shaped into the form of a boat, so narrow in proportion to its length as to be absolutely unstable but for the outrigger.\n\nThe outrigger, a long skate-shaped piece of wood fixed to port\u2014always to port\u2014by poles on a central bridge, is an apology to the sea for want of beam, and the sea accepts it\u2014on conditions. But for the outrigger, no canoe of any size would dare the sea, but for it the islands would have been sealed as between themselves, war made impossible, and the drift of people between island and island and between island and continent.\n\nFar away in the remote past some man once stood, the father of this daring invention; little dreaming of the vast consequences of the work to which he had put his hand.\n\nDick at the steering paddle saw a figure on the northern beach as they drew near. It was Katafa, waiting for him, the wind blowing her girdle of drac\u00e6na leaves and her hand sheltering her eyes against the sun. Standing just as Le Moan was standing on the southern beach sheltering her eyes and \u200bwatching the canoe that carried the first man who had ever made her turn her head.\n\nSome children were playing near Katafa and a fishing canoe was putting out near by, but he saw only Katafa.\n\n\u201cKatafa,\u201d said Aioma, who was crouched by the after outrigger pole. \u201cIt is she sure enough, and they said she was dead and that her ghost had returned bringing you with her, Taori, but the dead do not return. Katafa, she was the girl under the taboo of Taminan, the girl no man or woman might touch, and then one day she went fishing beyond the reef and a storm took her and she was drowned, so they said.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was not drowned,\u201d replied Dick. \u201cThe wind blew her to Marua where I was\u2014I and another whose face I have near forgotten, Kearney, he was called, and he made canoes but not like these, then one day he went among the trees and did not return. Then the god Nan came to the island and after him the men of Karolin who fought together so that all were killed, and then came the bad men as I have told you and would have killed us but we left Marua in the night.... Look, there is the canoe we came in.\u201d He pointed to the dinghy hauled up on the beach.\n\n\u201cO he! Taori!\u201d It was Katafa\u2019s voice hailing them from the shore, glad, sweet, clear as a bell, yet far-carrying as the voice of a gull.\n\nAs Dick sprang out on the sands he seized her in \u200bhis arms; parted only a few hours, it seemed to them that they had been weeks apart.\n\nIn the old days, even before he was born, his mother Emmeline had never been at ease when separated from his father even by the breadth of the lagoon, the demon that hints of mischance seemed always at her ear.\n\nDick seemed to have inherited with his power of love for Katafa, something of the dread of mischance for the beloved.\n\nHe embraced her, heedless of onlookers, though the only eyes to see were the eyes of the children and of Aioma who had eyes for nothing but the dinghy.\n\nAs soon as his foot touched sand, the canoe-builder made for it running like a boy, clapped his hand on the gunnel and then ran it over the planking.\n\nThe boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and had been destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ashore on the southern beach. The dinghy was carvel-built and entire, a perfect specimen of eastern boat-building over which the canoe designer brooded forgetful of Dick and Katafa, the beach he stood on and the sun that lit it.\n\nThe idea of a boat built of planking and not hollowed out of a tree trunk had been presented to him by the charred and shattered fragments of the Spanish boats, but how to get planking and how to bend it to the form he desired was beyond his imagination and beyond his means. He saw vaguely that these boats \u200bof the papalagi were made somewhat after the fashion of a man, with a backbone and ribs and a covering for the ribs, he saw that by this means enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger\u2014but then speed, where was there sign of speed in this thing squat and ugly?\n\nIn the early ages of the world in which Aioma still dwelt, ugliness had only two expressions, the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength.\n\nDick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost to be mistaken for a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far sight of the eyes and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy Aioma saw want of speed\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout which has neither keel nor ribs.\n\nThen Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision.\n\n\u200b\u201cWhich end is which of this pig fish?\u201d inquired Aioma of heaven and Dick, \u201cand he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\u201d\n\nDick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting at the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu which he and Katafa had made their own. There in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salved from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys\u2014fetiches from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where like a ghost in the sun dazzle moved a memory that was once a man\u2014Kearney.\n\nHe took the schooner from its rest and coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made.\n\nThe pool thirty feet long by twenty broad was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, it was clear as crystal, coral floored\u2014and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles, passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick on his knees launched the schooner and Aioma standing bent with a hand on each knee \u200bwatched her as she floated on an even keel. Then on the merry west wind with helm properly set and main boom guyed out she went sailing down the pool to the east where Katafa had run to receive her.\n\nAioma watched, then Dick running to the other end showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore and how to set the head sails,\u2014had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model, and Aioma watched vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, whilst the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific.\n\nBook 1\nReturn to the top of the page.\nChapter 2",
    "final_text": "### Chapter 3: The Little Ships\n\nThe traditional canoe of the Pacific is a dugout\u2014a tree trunk hollowed out and shaped into a boat. These canoes are narrow and unstable, but they're stabilized by an outrigger. The outrigger is a long, skate-shaped piece of wood attached to the side of the canoe by poles on a central bridge. It's a necessary addition to keep the canoe from tipping over in the sea. Without the outrigger, these canoes wouldn't be seaworthy, and the islands would be isolated, making travel and communication between them nearly impossible.\n\nCenturies ago, someone invented the outrigger, likely never imagining the profound impact it would have on island life. It enabled people to navigate the seas, connecting islands and continents, and even facilitating trade and warfare.\n\nAs Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted a figure waiting for him. It was Katafa, her hair blowing in the wind and her hand shielding her eyes from the sun. She stood just as Le Moan did on the southern beach, watching the canoe approach. Children played nearby, and a fishing canoe was setting out to sea, but Dick's eyes were fixed on Katafa.\n\n\u201cKatafa,\u201d Aioma, crouched by the after outrigger pole, said. \u201cIt\u2019s her, just as they said. They thought she was dead and that her ghost had returned with you, Taori. But the dead don\u2019t come back. Katafa was under the taboo of Taminan, untouchable by anyone. Then one day, she went fishing beyond the reef and was swept away by a storm. They said she drowned.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t drown,\u201d Dick replied. \u201cThe wind blew her to Marua, where I was. I was with Kearney, who built canoes differently. One day, he went into the forest and never returned. Then the god Nan came to the island, followed by the Karolin men who fought and were all killed. After that, bad men arrived and would have killed us, but we escaped Marua in the night. Look, there\u2019s the dinghy we came in.\u201d\n\nDick pointed to the small boat hauled up on the beach. As soon as his feet touched the sand, he ran to Katafa and embraced her. They had been apart for only a few hours, but it felt like weeks.\n\nDick\u2019s mother, Emmeline, had always been anxious when separated from his father, even by the width of a lagoon. Dick seemed to inherit that anxiety, feeling a deep dread of anything that might harm Katafa.\n\nAioma, the canoe-builder, immediately headed towards the dinghy, running like a boy. He ran his hand over the planking, marveling at the craftsmanship. The dinghy was carvel-built, with planks laid edge to edge, unlike the clinker-built boats of the Spanish ship that had been destroyed in a fight. The dinghy was a perfect example of eastern boat-building, and Aioma was captivated by it, forgetting everything else around him.\n\nThe idea of a boat built from planks rather than a hollowed-out tree trunk had been sparked by the remnants of the Spanish boats. However, Aioma couldn\u2019t figure out how to get the planks or bend them into the shape he wanted. He saw that these boats had a backbone and ribs, covered by planks, which gave them enough stability to do without an outrigger. But he wondered about speed\u2014these boats seemed slow and clumsy.\n\nAioma, standing in the sun, began to mock the dinghy. He chuckled at first, then laughed loudly, deriding its design. \u201cWhich end is which on this pig fish?\u201d he joked. \u201cAnd how many more like it did the maker build?\u201d\n\nDick, who had always associated the dinghy with Kearney, felt a pang of anger at Aioma\u2019s laughter. Perhaps it was the white man in him, revolting against the ridicule of a \u201csavage\u201d over the work of a white man. He turned and ran up the beach to the house he shared with Katafa. There, on a hastily built shelf, stood the little model ships he had rescued from Palm Tree: a frigate, a schooner, a full-rigged ship, and a whaler. These models were his last connection to civilization, toys from a distant past that now held a deeper significance.\n\nHe took the schooner model and ran to a large pool in the coral. The pool was clear and filled with tiny fish darting about. Dick launched the schooner, and Aioma watched as it floated smoothly. Dick demonstrated how the model could sail almost against the wind, showing off his deep knowledge of sailing. Aioma was fascinated, and soon they were both on their knees, playing with the model schooner in the pool. The little boat sailed from one end to the other, bowing to the ripples as if it were a real ship on the open sea.\n\nIn that moment, under the sun, the builders of Karolin\u2019s future fleet played like children, their eyes filled with wonder and excitement. The little schooner, a model of the lost Raratonga, sailed gracefully in its miniature sea, a symbol of the vast possibilities that lay ahead.",

He saw vaguely that these boats \u200bof the papalagi were made somewhat after the fashion of a man, with a backbone and ribs and a covering for the ribs, he saw that by this means enough beam could be obtained to enable the builder to dispense with the outrigger\u2014but then speed, where was there sign of speed in this thing squat and ugly?\n\nIn the early ages of the world in which Aioma still dwelt, ugliness had only two expressions, the lines that indicated want of speed and the lines that indicated want of strength.\n\nDick, though brown as the canoe-builder and almost to be mistaken for a true islander, was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the dinghy was a million years younger than the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, Aioma saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, to the far sight of the eyes and the breadth of the brow; in the dinghy Aioma saw want of speed\u2014he was blind to the nobility of type that made this bud the sister of a battleship, made it a vertebrate as against the dugout which has neither keel nor ribs.\n\nThen Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in the sight of God and a critic as every true workman is, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with a sound like the clacking of a hen, then with laughter long and loud and words of derision.\n\n\u200b\u201cWhich end is which of this pig fish?\u201d inquired Aioma of heaven and Dick, \u201cand he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\u201d\n\nDick, who had always connected the dinghy with Kearney, and who had a sort of faith that Kearney had made her just as he had made the little model ships, winced at the laughter of the old man. Perhaps it was the white man in him revolting at the derision of a savage over the works of the white man. However that may be, he turned and ran up the beach to the house of Uta Matu which he and Katafa had made their own. There in the shadow, on a hastily constructed shelf stood the little model ships he had so carefully salved from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization; toys of the long ago, but no longer toys\u2014fetiches from a world whose very language he had lost, a world of sun and tall trees where like a ghost in the sun dazzle moved a memory that was once a man\u2014Kearney.\n\nHe took the schooner from its rest and coming out with it, ran to a great pool in the coral, calling Aioma to come and see what he who made the dinghy had also made.\n\nThe pool thirty feet long by twenty broad was ruffled by the breeze from the sea, it was clear as crystal, coral floored\u2014and a trapped school of tiny fish no larger than needles, passed like a silver cloud here and there. Dick on his knees launched the schooner and Aioma standing bent with a hand on each knee \u200bwatched her as she floated on an even keel. Then on the merry west wind with helm properly set and main boom guyed out she went sailing down the pool to the east where Katafa had run to receive her.\n\nAioma watched, then Dick running to the other end showed him how she could sail almost against the wind. Dick knew every stick and string of her, how to hoist and lower main and fore and how to set the head sails,\u2014had you placed him on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his knowledge of the model, and Aioma watched vastly intrigued; then, taking a hand, he got on his knees and the great sun saw the builders of the future fleet of Karolin playing like children, whilst the little schooner on its imitation sea sailed from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of the great Pacific.\n\nBook 1\nReturn to the top of the page.\nChapter 2",
    "final_text": "### Chapter 3: The Little Ships\n\nThe traditional canoe of the Pacific is a dugout\u2014a tree trunk hollowed out and shaped into a boat. These canoes are narrow and unstable, but they're stabilized by an outrigger. The outrigger is a long, skate-shaped piece of wood attached to the side of the canoe by poles on a central bridge. It's a necessary addition to keep the canoe from tipping over in the sea. Without the outrigger, these canoes wouldn't be seaworthy, and the islands would be isolated, making travel and communication between them nearly impossible.\n\nCenturies ago, someone invented the outrigger, likely never imagining the profound impact it would have on island life. It enabled people to navigate the seas, connecting islands and continents, and even facilitating trade and warfare.\n\nAs Dick steered the canoe towards the northern beach, he spotted a figure waiting for him. It was Katafa, her hair blowing in the wind and her hand shielding her eyes from the sun. She stood just as Le Moan did on the southern beach, watching the canoe approach. Children played nearby, and a fishing canoe was setting out to sea, but Dick's eyes were fixed on Katafa.\n\n\u201cKatafa,\u201d Aioma, crouched by the after outrigger pole, said. \u201cIt\u2019s her, just as they said. They thought she was dead and that her ghost had returned with you, Taori. But the dead don\u2019t come back. Katafa was under the taboo of Taminan, untouchable by anyone. Then one day, she went fishing beyond the reef and was swept away by a storm. They said she drowned.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t drown,\u201d Dick replied. \u201cThe wind blew her to Marua, where I was. I was with Kearney, who built canoes differently. One day, he went into the forest and never returned. Then the god Nan came to the island, followed by the Karolin men who fought and were all killed. After that, bad men arrived and would have killed us, but we escaped Marua in the night. Look, there\u2019s the dinghy we came in.\u201d\n\nDick pointed to the small boat hauled up on the beach. As soon as his feet touched the sand, he ran to Katafa and embraced her. They had been apart for only a few hours, but it felt like weeks.\n\nDick\u2019s mother, Emmeline, had always been anxious when separated from his father, even by the width of a lagoon. Dick seemed to inherit that anxiety, feeling a deep dread of anything that might harm Katafa.\n\nAioma, the canoe-builder, immediately headed towards the dinghy, running like a boy. He ran his hand over the planking, marveling at the craftsmanship. The dinghy was carvel-built, with planks laid edge to edge, unlike the clinker-built boats of the Spanish ship that had been destroyed in a fight. The dinghy was a perfect example of eastern boat-building, and Aioma was captivated by it, forgetting everything else around him.\n\nThe idea of a boat built from planks rather than a hollowed-out tree trunk had been sparked by the remnants of the Spanish boats. However, Aioma couldn\u2019t figure out how to get the planks or bend them into the shape he wanted. He saw that these boats had a backbone and ribs, covered by planks, which gave them enough stability to do without an outrigger. But he wondered about speed\u2014these boats seemed slow and clumsy.\n\nAioma, standing in the sun, began to mock the dinghy. He chuckled at first, then laughed loudly, deriding its design. \u201cWhich end is which on this pig fish?\u201d he joked. \u201cAnd how many more like it did the maker build?\u201d\n\nDick, who had always associated the dinghy with Kearney, felt a pang of anger at Aioma\u2019s laughter. Perhaps it was the white man in him, revolting against the ridicule of a \u201csavage\u201d over the work of a white man. He turned and ran up the beach to the house he shared with Katafa. There, on a hastily built shelf, stood the little model ships he had rescued from Palm Tree: a frigate, a schooner, a full-rigged ship, and a whaler. These models were his last connection to civilization, toys from a distant past that now held a deeper significance.\n\nHe took the schooner model and ran to a large pool in the coral. The pool was clear and filled with tiny fish darting about. Dick launched the schooner, and Aioma watched as it floated smoothly. Dick demonstrated how the model could sail almost against the wind, showing off his deep knowledge of sailing. Aioma was fascinated, and soon they were both on their knees, playing with the model schooner in the pool. The little boat sailed from one end to the other, bowing to the ripples as if it were a real ship on the open sea.\n\nIn that moment, under the sun, the builders of Karolin\u2019s future fleet played like children, their eyes filled with wonder and excitement. The little schooner, a model of the lost Raratonga, sailed gracefully in its miniature sea, a symbol of the vast possibilities that lay ahead.",
