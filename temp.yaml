AI: '### Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder


  Dick stood on a coral outcrop, gazing southward. Behind him, the waves of the outer
  sea crashed against the reef, sending spray into the air. Before him, the lagoon
  of Karolin stretched out calmly, a vast expanse of blue water dotted with fishing
  gulls. This lagoon, enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a sea within a sea,
  changing with the weather from stormy to serene. It was now his, after landing here
  just the day before.


  Women, children, and youths bustled along the beach, fishing, playing, or tending
  to their paraka patches. They were all his people now. The canoes beached on the
  sand and the empty houses where war canoes once rested were his too.


  As he turned from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. He faced the
  breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond that horizon, invisible
  but ever-present, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream but teeming with
  danger.


  Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral. Tari was
  young and knew little of life, but he understood that the men of Karolin had been
  swept away by war, leaving the women, boys, and children defenseless. Then, yesterday,
  a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa,
  the girl who had been blown out to sea years ago. The women said this stranger was
  sent by the gods to be their new chief.


  Tari, curious and out of earshot of his mother, asked, "Taori, who are you?"


  Dick couldn''t answer Tari''s question fully. The name "Dick" had faded from his
  memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, the old sailor
  who had raised him, was almost forgotten, lost in the haze of his past. His memories
  began with Katafa''s arrival on Marua, the island Tari called Palm Tree. Beyond
  that, everything was blurred by the tropical light and storms.


  He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?"


  "I don''t know," Tari replied. "I ask as I breathe, but no one ever answers Tari''s
  questions." His attention was already diverted by the cries of children hauling
  in a net, and he trotted away.


  Dick''s gaze returned to the north. Tari''s question stirred memories of the schooner
  that had been burned on Palm Tree, of Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy,
  and of their landing on this beach yesterday. The women and children had swarmed
  around him, believing him to be sent by the gods to lead them.


  As he gazed northward, the memory of the men who had taken over Palm Tree stained
  the beauty of the sea and sky. They had no canoes yet, but they would build them.
  They would see the lagoon''s reflection in the sky and come. It might take time,
  but they would come.


  Dick was a blend of the local culture and the white man''s logic. He could think
  ahead, plan, and imagine. That''s why he had sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia,
  and Tafata, three old men skilled in canoe-building. He also noticed that nearly
  a hundred youths were reaching war age. But beneath it all, his passion for Katafa
  burned brightly, driving him to protect her and their people.


  A hand fell on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Katafa, a lock of her dark hair escaping
  her vine-bound braid, blowing in the breeze. Her eyes, luminous and dark, were fixed
  on the northern horizon.


  "Look," she said.


  Under certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became
  visible from Karolin through a mirage. Last evening they had seen it, and now it
  was beginning to appear again, a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, deepening
  and hardening until the island showed clearly, beautiful and vivid.


  They stood without speaking, their minds untutored in the science of mirages, their
  eyes fixed on the island from which they had escaped. They saw again the horde of
  savages on the beach, felt the wind filling the sail as they raced for safety, and
  heard the yells of the Melanesians, mad with stolen rum.


  Dick''s nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him,
  but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa. They would come someday, drawn
  by the lagoon''s light and the presence of women. He knew the danger lay not just
  to the north but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on the azure sea.


  Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded and vanished. As they turned from the sea
  to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It
  was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. They walked down to the white
  sand of the inner beach to meet it.'

  "The Gates of Morning"


  CHAPTER I


  THE CANOE BUILDER


  D

  ICK standing on a ledge of coral cast his eyes to the South.


  Behind him the breakers of the outer sea thundered and the spindrift scattered on
  the wind; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown
  about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.


  Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea
  of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure, in light airs—and it was his—he who had
  landed here only yesterday.


  Women, children, youths, all the tribe to be seen busy along the beach in the blazing
  sun, fishing with nets, playing their games or working on the paraka patches, all
  were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand and his the empty houses
  where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.


  Then as he cast his eyes from the lagoon to the canoe houses his brow contracted,
  and, turning his back to the lagoon he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach
  and the northern sea. Away there, ​beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree,
  an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.


  Little Tari the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sitting on the coral close by, looked
  up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin swept
  away by war had left the women and the boys and the children like himself defenceless
  and without a man or leader.


  Then, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat and with Katafa, the girl
  who had been blown to sea years ago when out fishing, this strange new figure had
  come, sent by the gods, so the women said, to be their chief and ruler.


  The child knew nothing of whom the gods might be nor did he care, alone now with
  this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he put the question
  direct with all the simplicity of childhood.


  “Taori,” said little Tari, “who are you?” (é kamina tai)


  Could Dick have answered, would the child have understood the strange words of the
  strange story Dick might have told him? “Tari, I come of people beyond the world
  you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, Tari, I was
  left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), which
  lies beyond sight fifty miles to the north. There we lived and there I grew to be
  a boy and Kearney, that was his name, taught me to fish and spear fish, and he made
  for me things to play with, little ships unlike the canoes of ​the islands. And
  then, Tari, one day long ago came Katafa, the girl who was blown away from here
  in a storm. She lived with us till Kearney died and then we two were alone. She
  taught me her language, which is the language of Karolin. She named me Taori; we
  loved one another and might have lived for ever at Marua had not a great ship come
  there filled with bad men, men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came
  to cut the trees. Then they rose and killed the white men with them and burned the
  ship and in our boat we escaped from them, taking with us everything we loved, even
  the little ships, and steering for Karolin, we came, led by the lagoon light in
  the sky."


  But he could not tell Tari this, or at least all of it, for the very name of Dick
  had passed from his memory, that and the language he had spoken as a child; Kearney,
  the sailor who had brought him up, was all but forgotten, all but lost sight of
  in the luminous haze that was his past.


  The past, for men long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and fogged, for Dick
  it began only with the coming of Katafa to Marua, behind and beyond that all was
  forgotten as though consumed in the great blaze of tropic light that bathed the
  island and the sea, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy
  seasons. Kearney would have been quite forgotten but for the little ships he had
  made as playthings for the boy—who was now a man.


  ​He looked down at the questioning child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?”


  “I do not know,” said the child. “I ask as I breathe but no big folk—madyana—will
  ever answer the questions of Tari— Ai, the fish!” His facile mind had already dropped
  the subject, attracted by the cries of some children, hauling in a net, and he rose
  and trotted away.


  Dick turned his gaze again to the north. The question of the child had stirred his
  mind and he saw again the schooner that had put in to Palm Tree only to be burned
  by the Melanesian hands, he saw again Katafa and himself as they made their escape
  in the old dinghy that Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He saw their landing
  on this beach, yesterday, and the women and children swarming round him, he the
  man whom they considered sent by the gods to be their chief and leader.


  Then as he gazed towards the north the memory of the men from whom he had escaped
  with the girl stained the beauty of sea and sky.


  There was no immediate fear of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree; the
  men of Palm Tree had no canoes, but they would build canoes—surely they would build
  canoes, and as surely they would see the far mirror blaze of Karolin lagoon in the
  sky, just as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be a very long time yet,
  but they would come.


  Dick was an all but blook, a kanaka, a savage, ​and yet the white man was there.
  He could think forward, he could think round a subject and he could imagine.


  That was why he had sent a canoe that morning across to the southern beach to fetch
  Aioma, Palia and Tafata, three old men, too old for war, but expert canoe-builders,
  that was why when gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened
  to the fact that nearly a hundred of the youths were ripening to war age, but under
  all, lighting and animating his mind, raising daring to eagle heights, lay his passion
  for Katafa, his other self more dear to him than self, threatened, ever so vaguely,
  yet still threatened.


  War canoes! Did he intend fighting any invaders in the lagoon or as they drew towards
  shore, or did he vaguely intend to be the attacker, destroying the danger at its
  source before it could develop? Who knows?



  A hand fell upon his shoulder and turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa,
  a lock of her dark hair escaped from the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blew
  right back on the breeze like an eagle’s feather, and her eyes, luminous and dark
  instead of meeting his, were fixed towards the point where he had been gazing—the
  due-north sea line.


  “Look!” said Katafa.


  At big intervals and in certain conditions of weather Palm Tree, though far behind
  the sea line, ​became visible from Karolin through mirage. Last evening they had
  seen it and now again it was beginning to live, to bloom, to come to life, a mysterious
  stain low down in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea dazzle, that deepened
  by degrees and hardened till as if sketched in by some unseen painter, the island
  showed beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.


  With her hand upon his shoulder they stood without speaking, their minds untutored,
  knowing nothing of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped
  and which was rising now so strangely beyond the far sea line as if to gaze at them.


  They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as the forms
  in a nightmare, they felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced
  for safety and the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians mad
  with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in, and which they had burnt.
  And there, there before them lay the scene of the Tragedy, that lovely picture which
  showed nothing of the demons that still in habited it.


  Then as Dick gazed on this loveliness, which was yet a threat and a warning, his
  nostrils expanded and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him—that
  was nothing, they had threatened Katafa, that was everything—and they still threatened
  her.


  Some day they would come. The vision of Palm ​Tree seemed to repeat what instinct
  told him. They would build canoes and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky,
  they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women, and instinct
  half whispered to him that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men
  be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some
  island whose tribe might be raided of its women and seeing the lagoon light they
  would come.


  Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed or desire
  or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves
  of civilization.


  To Dick there was no world beyond the world of water that ringed the two islands;
  no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life as the life
  of Katafa, and yet even in that life, short as it was, he had learned to dread men
  and he had envisaged the foundation of all history—man’s instinct for war, rapine
  and destruction.


  Then gradually the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and pass, suddenly it vanished
  like a light blown out and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed
  across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.


  It was the canoe Dick has sent for the canoe builders and, leaving the coral, they
  came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
